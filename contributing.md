# Contribution Guidelines

## Adding a new language

A language's section should follow this format, as a second level heading and
below:

## Subject
*Description*
### Learning
* Thing 1 &mdash; Short description of Thing 1
* Thing 2 &mdash; Short description of Thing 2
### Culture
* Thing 3 &mdash; Short description of Thing 3

Those are `&mdash;` 

Learning resources include documentation and tutorials for direct learning.

Culture resources are resources that are important to that language's ecosystem,
such as a popular speaker within its community or common guidelines for
efficient style.

## Adding a new first level heading

This list is general, so it welcomes the addition of new sections, but just keep
in mind that a first level heading should be able to support many second level
heading topics.

## Spellchecking

This project includes a setup for spellchecking with npm packages. To use it,

1) install npm
2) run `npm install`
3) run `npm test`
